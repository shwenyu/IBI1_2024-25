The practical 3,4,6 have full 100 socres.
While the practical 5 only have 92 for the lack of output of dictionary.
I find out that I only defined the dictionary but forgot the print it out.
And I also found the potential problem that in practical 5, the table can't properly open if I don't set the working directory.
