This course and three projects are much trickier than previous ones.
For the first two programs, it takes time to find out how to succeed the bionomial graph
The third one is the most difficult, in which I use recursion but failed because limited infection scope.
My first thought was to use recursion, but something wrong and only small range of population infected.
That may caused by contradictory parts of loop
Then I used normal loops with better judgement and that works.
